# Final Project Proposal
## Virtual Pet

### Project Outline
The project that I am planning to devise is a pet simulation, which is a Tamagotchi played on PC. Initially, the user will choose a pet of their own(1). Every several hours, the user need to feed the virtual pet with food and water, and the pet will produce gold coins and poops. The user can collect coins in order to purchase some better food and toys for the pet, and the pet will produce gold more efficiently. The player also needs to clean the poops produced by the pet, otherwise the health condition of the pet will be compromised. The coins serve as the money to purchase goods and also the score of the player(2).

### Purpose
I would like to keep a pet, but pets are too time and money-consuming, so a virtual one would be such a relief. I had a virtual pet before when I was in elementary school, and I would like to design a pet simulator by myself.

### Timeline
First week: Construct the overall structure of classes and the functions within each class.
Second week: Configure the Cinder to accomodate my class implementation.
Third week: Polish the appearance of each element in Cinder and improve the structures.
Fourth week: Wrap-up of the first three weeks.

### Further Improvement
(1) in the Project Outline can be changed to letting players draw their own desired pet.
(2) in the Project Outline can be changed to maintaining a leaderboard of all players according to their scores.
